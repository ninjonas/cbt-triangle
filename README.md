# The Cognitive Triangle

## What is the Cognitive Triangle?
CBT emphasizes the relationship between our thoughts, our feelings, and our behaviors. More specifically, how our thoughts change the way that we feel, which subsequently changes the way that we act, which then influences our thoughts. Without intervention, the process continues to repeat. The triangle looks a little something like this:

## What is this Project?
I've dealt with some life changing experiences in the past few years that have given me severe anxiety. After working with my therapist for over a year, they have showed me techniques to help me rationalize my thoughts. The Cognitive Triangle helped me. 

During my low points, I have used this method religiously. Over time, I'm able to now be aware of my feelings and have become calmer. I still have feelings of insecureties one in a while and I've been forgetting to log my cognitions.

I'm hoping this project will help me easily log my cognitions and hopefully start tracking trends what cognitions I should work on
