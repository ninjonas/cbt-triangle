# The Cognitive Triangle

## What is the Cognitive Triangle?

The cognitive triangle is a simple [CBT](https://aanmc.org/naturopathic-medicine/cognitive-triangle-cbt/) tool you can use to help break negative thought patterns. It is
similar to keeping a thought record, but has more structure and requires you to positively reappraise your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as opposed to just your
thoughts. 7

The cognitive triangle is a graph depicting thoughts, feelings, and behaviors all leading to one another, as shown below:

## What is this Project?

Over the past few years, I’ve experienced some life-changing events that have led to severe anxiety. After working with my therapist for over a year, I’ve learned
techniques to help me rationalize my thoughts. One of the most impactful tools has been the Cognitive Triangle.

During my lowest moments, I relied on this method consistently. Over time, it has helped me become more aware of my emotions and maintain a greater sense of calm. While I
still experience moments of insecurity, I’ve noticed that I’ve been forgetting to log my cognitions regularly.

With this project, I hope to make it easier to track and log my thoughts, and even identify patterns in the cognitions I need to work on. This method has been
transformative for me, and I’m excited to share it with anyone who finds their way to this repository.
