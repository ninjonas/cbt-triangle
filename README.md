# The Cognitive Triangle

## What is the Cognitive Triangle?

The cognitive triangle is a simple [CBT](https://aanmc.org/naturopathic-medicine/cognitive-triangle-cbt/) tool you can use to help break negative thought patterns. It is
similar to keeping a thought record, but has more structure and requires you to positively reappraise your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as opposed to just your
thoughts. 7

The cognitive triangle is a graph depicting thoughts, feelings, and behaviors all leading to one another, as shown below:

## What is this Project?

I've dealt with some life changing experiences in the past few years that have given me severe anxiety. After working with my therapist for over a year, they have showed
me techniques to help me rationalize my thoughts. The Cognitive Triangle helped me.

During my low points, I have used this method religiously. Over time, I'm able to now be aware of my feelings and have become calmer. I still have feelings of
insecureties one in a while and I've been forgetting to log my cognitions.

I'm hoping this project will help me easily log my cognitions and hopefully start tracking trends what cognitions I should work on
